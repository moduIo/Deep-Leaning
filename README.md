# Deep-Learning
Implementations for problems and examples found in "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn &amp; Tensorflow"

This repo contains my personal implementations of examples given in the Tensorflow book.  Although many of the examples are copied directly from the text, I try to document them thoroughly and include custom explanations of the implementations.  

I find that documenting program fragments increases my level of understanding of the underlying code and algorithms.  

Hopefully others may also find my comments useful in understanding the book and deep learning in practice.
